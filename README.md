# Running the project
This project uses the Next.js framework, which needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to work.<br>
<br>
There was a problem during the npm installation of the project, so it needs to be installed in 2 diferent places.<br>
Starting from the root directory:
```
npm install
cd app
npm install
```
<br>
To run the project, go to the <code>app</code> folder and run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
